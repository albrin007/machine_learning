# Car Price Prediction - Regression Models

This project demonstrates the use of five regression models to predict car prices based on various features. The models include:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Gradient Boosting Regressor
5. Support Vector Regressor

The dataset used in this project is the **CarPrice_Assignment** dataset, which contains details about various cars, such as their specifications, features, and prices.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure to install the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Project Structure

```
CarPrice_Prediction/
│
├── car_price_prediction.py   # Main Python script containing model implementation
├── CarPrice_Assignment.csv   # CSV file containing car price dataset
├── README.md                 # This file
```

## Steps in the Code

### 1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**

- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`CarPrice_Assignment.csv`).
- Missing values are handled by filling:
  - Numeric columns with the mean of the respective column.
  - Categorical columns with the most frequent value (mode).
  
### 2. **Model Implementation**

Five regression models are implemented and evaluated:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
5. **Support Vector Regressor**

The models are trained using the training data and evaluated on the test data using three metrics:
- **R² Score**: The proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**

After training and predicting with each model, the performance of each model is compared using the above metrics.

### 4. **Feature Importance Analysis**

For the **Random Forest Regressor**, the feature importance is displayed to identify which features have the most impact on the target variable (`price`).

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

Hyperparameter tuning is performed on the **Random Forest Regressor** using **GridSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters for the model. The model is then re-evaluated with the tuned parameters.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the `CarPrice_Assignment.csv` file is in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script `car_price_prediction.py` to execute the code:

```bash
python car_price_prediction.py
```

This will:
- Load the dataset.
- Handle missing values.
- Train the models and evaluate them.
- Display the model performance and feature importance.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest Regressor.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how different regression algorithms can be applied to predict car prices. The results help identify the most suitable model for predicting car prices based on the features provided.

### Notes:
- Replace `/content/CarPrice_Assignment.csv` with the correct path to the dataset if you're running the code in a different environment.
- The dataset is assumed to contain a column named `price`, which is the target variable.
